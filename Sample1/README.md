# Web Development Sample

The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate my ability to problem solve using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript & jQuery. For this sample, I was tasked with implementing in-game password changing functionality in a way that prevents players from typing their own text in order to diminish the risk of players submitting real passwords or sensitive PII. To accomplish this, I implemented a virtual keyboard with limited buttons that create and remove option elements inside of the appropriate select element. In practice, the values for the buttons come from a database table, but in this sample I have hardcoded several values instead. Once a player has created the desired password combination, they can attempt to submit the form. The total length of the password combination from the option elements is calculated and the player is prevented from submitting passwords greater than 20 characters. Additionally, an error message is displayed if there is no password combination. CSS was used extensively, including in the use of creating a blinking animation for the cursor shown in the password display area and also in the creation of media queries to ensure that this page is responsive. For this sample, all output in displayed in the console, rather than truly submitting the form.
