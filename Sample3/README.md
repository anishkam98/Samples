# Flask Chat Application
This coding sample is still in progress.

This is a simple chat application that uses socketio for real-time bidirectional communications. Users can create an account, login, and chat with other users that are online. Bootstrap is primarily used for styling and an ER diagram of the database is included. Additionally, the application is containerized using Docker.
